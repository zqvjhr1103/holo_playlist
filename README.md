# holo_playlist

I wanted to create a playlist of Uta-Waku.

However, youtube did not have a timed playlist.

So, I created this site.

Playlist file format↓

File name: hogehoge.playlist

File contents:

    Password

    musicName,videoID,startTime,endTime

                    ⋮

    PLAYLIST_END_POINT
